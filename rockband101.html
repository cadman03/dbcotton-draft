                <h5>Background</h5><p>
                   Dennis Cotton of Cotton School of Drumming, and Michael Kevetos of Mach 1 Music came together in 2015 to accomplish one common goal... TO ROCK!
                   Since then, the program has played north of 100 gigs, taught over 60 students, and most importantly, rocked the hell out! They currently have 5 bands, 27 students, 
                   and continue to embed the spirit of rock and roll in the community. PLUS!! It's not just for kids! There are two adult bands as well. 
                </p>
                <p>ROCK BAND 101 will strive to teach all aspects of being in a Rock Band;  from practice strategies, rehearsals, setting up and tearing down equipment to more cerebral 
                    elements such as commitment, teamwork, and self-confidence. We also cover emotional components of interpersonal band dynamics, leadership skills, and group decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>Many students from Rock Band 101 have went on to study music at college, and carry the knowledge they gained with them throughout their lives.</p>
