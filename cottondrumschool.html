                <p><b>Lessons are tailored for each student:</b> <br>Dennis says, “All emerging drummers learn differently and have different goals.
                    In order to teach effectively, I customize each lesson for that student. While I have my tried and true methods, there is no
                    “cookie cutter” approach to teaching. Above all, I have fun teaching and my students have fun learning. With this attitude, success is guaranteed.”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is expected from students:</b> <br>Commitment, and a positive attitude.
                </p>
                <p><b>Dennis Cotton teaches with patience and enthusiasm. All lesson are taught with humor in a fun and relaxed manner.</b></p>
                <p>Dennis Cotton taught in New York State from 1989-2006. NYS has exacting standards for it’s music students. Dennis student’s excelled in
                    proficiency in the New York State Scholastic Music Associations (NYSSMA) annual solo competitions. Dennis’s students achieved perfect scores 93% of the time!</p>
                <p>
                    Several of Dennis’s students have received scholarships for drumming at Universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of Dennis’s students have gone on to play music professionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dennis’s “hybrid” teaching method combines his extensive professional background with his 20 plus years teaching scholastic music. This creates a more
                    rounded learning experience with enough depth to be useful to any emergent drummers needs.
